# Phase 4: Production Integration (Week 4)

**Goal**: Finalize production system with monitoring and documentation

## 4.1 Agent Monitoring and Reporting
**Deliverable**: CLI commands for viewing agent execution results and status
**Acceptance Criteria**: Users can view agent outputs, execution logs, and cost reports
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 complete (agent orchestration working)
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

- [ ] 4.1.1 Add `flashback agents --status` command to view agent execution status
- [ ] 4.1.2 Add `flashback agents --reports` command to view all agent output files
