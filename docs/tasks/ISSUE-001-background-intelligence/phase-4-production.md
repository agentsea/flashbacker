- [ ] 4.1.2 Add user-configurable model selection for audits (gpt-5-nano default)
- [ ] 4.1.3 Create audit execution using memory audit template from Phase 2
- [ ] 4.1.4 Add audit logging and results storage in memory ARCHIVE
- [ ] 4.1.5 Test weekly audit with real memory files and various model selections

## 4.2 Memory Decay Implementation
**Deliverable**: Intelligent memory decay system with confidence scoring
**Acceptance Criteria**: Old, irrelevant memories automatically archived with user oversight
**Dependencies**: 4.1 complete
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

- [ ] 4.2.1 Implement confidence scoring for memory entries using weekly audit results
- [ ] 4.2.2 Add age-based decay calculation (30-90 days configurable threshold)
- [ ] 4.2.3 Create decay recommendation system (suggest, don't auto-delete)
- [ ] 4.2.4 Test decay system with aged memory files from real projects

## 4.3 Model Sweep Framework
**Deliverable**: Bulk correction capabilities for periodic large-scale memory updates
**Acceptance Criteria**: Users can trigger model sweeps with higher-powered models when needed
**Dependencies**: 4.1 complete
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

- [ ] 4.3.1 Create `flashback audit --sweep` command for bulk memory corrections
- [ ] 4.3.2 Add model selection for sweeps (user choice: gpt-5-nano/mini/full)
- [ ] 4.3.3 Implement cost estimation and user confirmation for expensive sweeps
- [ ] 4.3.4 Test model sweep with gpt-5-mini and gpt-5 for comprehensive analysis

## 4.4 Debt Hunter Background Integration
**Deliverable**: Integration with existing debt-hunter.ts for background hallucination detection
**Acceptance Criteria**: Background daemon can trigger debt-hunter scans via templates
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 complete
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

- [ ] 4.4.1 Create template for AI model to decide when hallucination scanning needed
- [ ] 4.4.2 Integrate background daemon with existing `debt-hunter.ts` command

## 4.6 Documentation Updates
**Deliverable**: Updated documentation following existing patterns
**Acceptance Criteria**: README.md and CLAUDE.md reflect new capabilities
**Dependencies**: 4.5 complete
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

- [ ] 4.6.1 Update README.md with background intelligence overview
- [ ] 4.6.2 Update CLAUDE.md with new development patterns and utilities
- [ ] 4.6.3 Add user guide for weekly audits and model selection
- [ ] 4.6.4 Create troubleshooting guide for common background intelligence issues

## 4.7 Production Testing with Real Portfolio
**Deliverable**: Complete system validation with actual user projects
**Acceptance Criteria**: System operates reliably across diverse real projects
**Dependencies**: 4.1-4.6 complete
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

- [ ] 4.7.1 Test complete system with real project portfolio over 7 days
- [ ] 4.7.2 Validate weekly audits run successfully with different model selections
- [ ] 4.7.3 Confirm memory decay suggestions are accurate and helpful
- [ ] 4.7.4 Test model sweeps provide valuable bulk corrections

## 4.8 Final Architecture Validation
**Deliverable**: System ready for production following all Flashbacker patterns
**Acceptance Criteria**: Complete adherence to Hybrid AI+Computer Operations Pattern
**Dependencies**: 4.7 complete
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

- [ ] 4.8.1 Final validation: daemon is DUMB, AI model is SMART, tools are DUMB
- [ ] 4.8.2 Confirm zero embedded intelligence in daemon or CLI code
- [ ] 4.8.3 Test user model controls work properly (no automatic cost escalation)
