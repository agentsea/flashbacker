# Contributing to Flashbacker

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Flashbacker! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this project.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x, 20.x, or 22.x LTS
- npm 9.x or later
- Git

### Development Setup
```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/agentsea/flashbacker.git
cd flashbacker

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build the project
npm run build

# 4. Link globally for testing
npm link

# 5. Verify installation
flashback --version
```

## ✅ Running Tests (Contributors)

End users don’t need tests. These are for contributors:

```bash
# Unit tests (with coverage)
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests (with coverage)
npm run test:integration

# Install E2E (no coverage): packs, installs to temp prefix, inits, asserts PM2 ecosystem
npm run test:install
```

Notes:
- PM2 is auto-installed during install/link via postinstall/prereqs/installer.
- The install E2E avoids coverage thresholds to prevent noise; keep coverage gates for unit/integration.

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. **Make your changes**: Follow the coding standards below
3. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure your changes work as expected
4. **Run quality checks**: `npm run lint && npm run build`
5. **Commit**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages
6. **Push and create PR**: Submit a pull request with description

### Code Quality Standards
```bash
# Before submitting PRs, ensure:
npm run lint          # ESLint passes
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix formatting issues
npm run build         # TypeScript compiles successfully
```

## 📋 Pull Request Process

### Requirements
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- [ ] All lint checks pass (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Changes are well-documented
- [ ] PR description clearly explains the changes

### PR Template
When creating a PR, please include:
- **What**: Brief description of the change
- **Why**: Reason for the change
- **How**: Technical approach taken
- **Testing**: How you tested the changes

## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### Template-Driven System
- **Never hardcode file lists**: Use dynamic template scanning
- **Follow existing patterns**: Check `src/commands/` for examples
- **Use proper error handling**: All functions should handle errors gracefully

### Code Patterns
- **CLI Commands**: Add to `src/commands/` with Commander.js integration
- **Utilities**: Use `src/utils/` for shared functionality
- **Templates**: Add to `templates/.claude/` directory structure

## 🐛 Bug Reports

### Before Reporting
1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Test with the latest version
3. Run `flashback doctor` for diagnostics

### Bug Report Template
- **Environment**: Node.js version, OS, Flashbacker version
- **Steps to reproduce**: Clear, step-by-step instructions
- **Expected behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual behavior**: What actually happens
- **Additional context**: Screenshots, error messages, etc.

## 💡 Feature Requests

### Guidelines
- Check existing issues and discussions first
- Clearly explain the use case and benefit
- Consider if it fits Flashbacker's core mission
- Provide examples of how it would work

## 🎯 Areas for Contribution

### High-Impact Areas
- **New AI Personas**: Add specialized analysis personas
- **Code Quality Commands**: Enhance debt-hunter or add new analyzers
- **Documentation**: Improve guides, examples, and clarity
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage
- **Performance**: Optimize CLI responsiveness

### Good First Issues
- Documentation improvements
